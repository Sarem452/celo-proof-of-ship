# üöÄ Celo Proof of Ship

This repository contains my first deployed smart contract on **Celo Mainnet**.  
It serves as a public proof of ship to show that I successfully created and deployed a token.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps I Followed

1. Added **Celo Mainnet** to MetaMask:
   - RPC URL: `https://forno.celo.org`
   - Chain ID: `42220`
   - Currency Symbol: `CELO`
